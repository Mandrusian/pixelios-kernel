## checked
tools/ci-kernel (waits for CI, does not build), tools/xnu-cc.py (replays single compile commands from a CI log, syntax check only,
needs an Apple clang), tools/stack-apply (patch apply check only). None builds a kernel. Related: TP-005.

## why
CI round trip ~4 min per kernel. Local Linux build, measured 2026-10-22: cold 71 s, no-op 3 s, one changed patch 16 s.

## output
Short report, last line `RESULT: PASS|FAIL|ERROR ...`; exit 0/1/2; kernel copied to ~/pixelios-artifacts/localbuild/out/kernel.development.sweet;
logs in ~/pixelios-artifacts/scratch/xnu-local-build.log and <work tree>/build.log.

## risks
No device access, no root. The local kernel is not byte-identical to CI (stock clang, theos ld64, stand-in iig); boot-test it on the phone
before trusting it, and use CI for anything that gets committed as a result. Uses ~3.2 GB under ~/pixelios-artifacts/localbuild; one make -j4 at a time.

## amendments
(none)
