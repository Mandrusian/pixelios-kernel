 * RAM log for the probe console: every console line is also appended here
 * (fixed .bss buffer, no malloc) so the whole report survives the live run
 * and the pager can replay it after the probe finishes. When the buffer
 * fills, whole oldest lines are evicted, so no stored line is ever torn.
 *
 * Pure C with no board or asm dependencies: shim/ramlog_host_test.c
 * exercises wraparound/overflow directly on the host.
