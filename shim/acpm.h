/*
 * acpm.h - minimal ACPM (APM firmware) client: read / update one S2MPG10 register through the shared-memory IPC channel.
 * Built only from docs/research/23-acpm-regulator-client.md (every constant is cited in acpm.c). Used by the shim touch probe
 * (--touch-probe=railsr / rails) to ask the APM to read or set the enable bit (bit 7) of LDO25M (0x5C) / LDO26M (0x5D).
 *
 * The APM firmware owns the SRAM, so the code is defensive: it reads and validates the channel descriptor first, refuses to
 * write unless the queues are empty and every assumption that doc 23 tags [guess] has been marked verified in soc.json
 * ("acpm": layout_verified, elem_unit_verified, per-rail vsel range), writes only the one request slot it uses, the two queue
 * pointers and the two mailbox registers (all through the allowlisted w32 in acpm.c), and bounds the reply wait. Once the request
 * queue's front pointer is written the request is PUBLISHED: the APM may already be executing it, so nothing is ever rolled back
 * (Linux never does: acpm_ipc.c:762-772). A failure after that point reports the queue state and leaves the channel as it is.
 * No retries, no static state.
